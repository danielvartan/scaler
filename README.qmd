## Overview

`scaler` is an R package that provides a set of tools to deal with health measurement scales. Its aim is to facilitate the work of researchers with these kind of data and to improve reproducibility in research.

Some scales require a dedicated package. If you're looking for tools to process the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire ([MCTQ](https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730402239679)), please check the [`mctq`](https://github.com/ropensci/mctq) package.

## Installation

You can install `scaler` using the [`remotes`](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) package:

``` {r}
#| eval: false

remotes::install_github("danielvartan/scaler")
```

## Citation

If you use `scaler` in your research, please consider citing it. We put a lot of work to build and maintain a free and open-source R package. You can find the citation below.
